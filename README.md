# White-Wine-EDA
Project to exercise exploratory data analysis skills.

Sources:
I used the provided example project by Udacity as a resource: https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud651/diamondsExample_2016-05.html.

Also used a website to assist with plot colors: http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour

I utliyzed lessons from the relevant Exploratory Data Analysis module to aid in the development of some data analyzation code.
